# 🛡️ FFT Anomaly Detection System - v17.0

FFT is an advanced cybersecurity analysis tool that detects suspicious activity and DDoS attacks in network traffic using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**.

Unlike classic signature-based systems, it detects anomalies by analyzing the rhythm and frequency spectrum of traffic.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Spectral Analysis:**

Captures periodic attack signatures by transferring network packets from the time domain to the frequency domain.

- **Real-Time Visualization:**

Presents packet density and FFT spectrum in real-time graphs.

- **Advanced Anomaly Engine:**

Calculates packet changes within seconds statistically and generates an **"Anomaly Score"**.

- **Cybersecurity Dashboard:**

Professional *Dark Mode* interface and terminal-based reporting system.

- **Fast PCAP Processing:**

Scapy analyzes thousands of packets in seconds without slowing down the computer, thanks to its `PcapReader` architecture.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Infrastructure

The system treats network traffic as a **signal**.

- Random human traffic → *White Noise*

- Bots / flood tools → Repeating signals at a fixed frequency

Thanks to this difference, the system detects attacks based on frequency.

### Technologies Used

- Python 3.12+
- Scapy → Packet parsing and PCAP reading
- NumPy & SciPy → FFT and statistical analysis
- Matplotlib → Graph plotting
- Tkinter → Interface and threading support

---

## 💻 Installation and Running

### 1️⃣ Required Libraries

```

pip install scapy numpy scipy matplotlib

```

### 2️⃣ Start the System

```
python3 main_program.py

```

### 🧪 Generating Test Data (Optional)

15-second attack traffic simulation:

```

sudo hping3 -S -p 80 --flood 127.0.0.1

```

### 📊 Analysis Outputs

**📈 Time Series**

**Traffic intensity second by second**

**⚡ FFT Spectrum**

**If there is a sharp spike at a specific frequency → most likely an attack**

**Flat distribution → normal traffic**
